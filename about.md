I'm currently a Helen Fellow at the American Museum of Natural History, where I study the genomes of cnidarians and teach high school girls the ins and outs of data science! 

I'll be starting at The New Yorker as an editorial production associate come this August.

Drop me a line at madelyne at alumni dot stanford dot edu -- I'd love to collaborate on writing projects, scicomm projects, etc. 

I'm @madxiaodisease in some places and Madelyne everywhere else.
