I'm currently a fact checker at _The New Yorker_, where I work with writers and editors on print and digital editions of the magazine and contribute capsule book reviews.

In past lives, I've researched marine invertebrates at the American Museum of Natural History, reviewed submissions to the _Quarterly_ at McSweeney's, and reported on infectious disease research at the National Institutes of Health.

I'm @madxiaodisease in some places and Madelyne everywhere else.

#### things I'm thinking about:

- a few years ago, the Los Angeles Review of Books published a great [twelve-part interview series](https://lareviewofbooks.org/feature/the-digital-in-the-humanities) on digital humanities and its practitioners; 

- from Quanta, a [report](https://www.quantamagazine.org/math-of-the-penguins-20200817/) on a favorite niche topic: innate number sense in the non-human animal kingdom;

- [oulipo and constrained writing](https://believermag.com/la-bibliotheque-impossible/) -- the subject of an honors thesis that I started and never completed;

- drop me a line if you're [down for a cross](https://downforacross.com/);

- the [MIT Puzzle Hunt](https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/nexthunt.html) was remote in 2021;

- [silken tofu + century egg](https://omnivorescookbook.com/tofu-with-century-egg-salad/)
