I'm currently an editorial staffer at _The New Yorker_, where I produce print and digital editions of the magazine and write capsule book reviews.

In past lives, I've researched marine invertebrates at the American Museum of Natural History, reviewed submissions to the _Quarterly_ at McSweeney's, and reported on infectious disease research at the National Institutes of Health.

I'm @madxiaodisease in some places and Madelyne everywhere else.
