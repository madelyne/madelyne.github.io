`Structures are the weapon of the mathematician.'  
- Nicolas Bourbaki 


For a brief time in 1960s America, elementary school students learned set theory before they studied their sums. Other topics in the New Mathematics curriculum, which reads like the course plan of a pure math concentrator in college: abstract algebra, modular arithmetic, symbolic logic. This brief and ecstatic (for the mathematicians who designed it, in any case) turn towards pure math in public schools was due in large part to a push for accelerated math and science education following the launch of Sputnik and the specter of Soviet dominance. 

Many of the results of analysis and algebra that so dominated New Math existed in disorganized fragments, scattered across texts divergent in rigor, style, and language. As such, the foundation of modern mathematics owes much to Nicolas Bourbaki. The author of Les ments des Mathématiques, a sly tribute to Euclid's landmark _Elements_, Bourbaki introduced a new rigor to analysis and algebra and introduced notation still in use in contemporary mathematics, including the empty set ∅ -- the set containing no elements -- and dangerous bend <img src="dangerous-bend.png" width="20" height="25" /> -- used to demarcate difficult arguments. The effect of Bourbaki's text was to consolidate, elucidate, and make self-contained known results. 

For a single author, Bourbaki had an impressive oeuvre (Les Éléments consisted of ten subsections on topics beginning with set theory and ending with algebraic topology) -- and, in fact, Bourbaki was not a lone mathematician, but a constantly-changing group of mostly French mathematicians writing under a pseudonym. A dozen strong at its (his?) largest, Bourbaki was led by the number theorist and geometer André Weil (other, associated mathematicians: Alexandre Grothendieck, Henri Cartan, Laurent Schwartz, Claude Chevalley). The group was remarkable for its cohesion and congenial dedication to a single program of mathematical writing: for its 'enthusiasm, friendship, schoolboy solidarity, and belief in a common goal.' Remarkably, votes on the work to enter each page of the text received unanimous approval from the group's members; additionally, each member of Bourbaki, regardless of seniority, had veto rights regarding inclusion or exclusion of certain topics in the text. (On a less serious note: possessed of the kind of playful confidence that comes with a semi-formal pseudonym, Bourbaki once critiqued the work of another mathematician, who returned fire by accusing Bourbaki of his true identity. Bourbaki wrote this mathematician again, this time in indignant protest of his (true) accusation.)

A search of academic papers on Bourbaki yields (unsurprisingly) purely mathematical treatments of the work, including some new results on Bourbaki's eponymous prime ideals. Meanwhile, current research on the New Mathematics are primarily historical and/or pedagogical. A paper from 2001 explores the history of New Math and its relationship with the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Standards, beginning from an assumption that the movement was a failed one, and offering reasons for its failure. 

The intensity of pure mathematics can come as a shock to the uninitiated, the writer of this thesis included. Like many other initiates of high school calculus, I entered college under the assumption that most math was computational, and that 'being good at math' entailed a near-mechanical proficiency with calculations. As such, most graduates of non-elite high schools in the past few decades receive little to no exposure to proof-based mathematics before college, and their first experience in a college math class can be a shock to the senses. They quickly realize, as well, that the bulk of primary and secondary school mathematics teaching is heavily computational and applications-oriented, with little coverage of mathematical logic (indeed, even Bourbaki originally hoped to select subject matter for their text based on its usefulness to physicists and engineers). My interest in this topic was piqued by this lapse in my own math education and a desire, after learning about the New Math, to understand how the US secondary curriculum moved so quickly from applied to pure and back to applied math again. 

My goal in writing this paper is to trace the effects of Bourbaki's re-writing on the development of New Math, with some discussion on the lasting impacts of both on modern mathematical semantics and education. In doing so, I will also provide an analysis of the Bourbaki text itself, taking it in comparison with the university texts that spurred the Bourbakis to begin their project. My approach to this will be threefold -- as many writers on this topic have done, I will provide a historical treatment of New Math and Bourbaki in my first chapter, followed by a discussion of the formalism and structure of both the mathematics and writing presented in Les Éléments. This will proceed from an evaluation of Les Éléments as a piece of literature and, also, as a body of mathematical work. My third and last chapter will place both of these analyses in the context of modern mathematics education. From a mostly pedagogical standpoint, I will evaluate Bourbaki's contributions to math teaching today. For the purposes of this project, I address Bourbaki's Les Éléments; in particular, I will discuss the volumes on set theory and analysis (try as I may, it would be impossible to provide a comprehensive overview of all 7000 pages!). 

###Methods
Though the content of this thesis may veer towards the purely mathematical, my intention is that this paper should be easily understandable to anyone with an elementary-school understanding of math. I will be exploring concepts from set theory, analysis, and algebra in the second chapter, which is the analysis of Bourbaki's text. Fortunately, many foundational concepts of set theory and analysis are immediately intuitive. Notions of inclusion, exclusion, and intersection of sets can be explained to elementary school students, and some would argue that the object of analysis is to make the intuitive absolutely rigorous (and, for the author of this thesis, absolutely non-intuitive). I will attempt to give some intuition for abstract terms and concepts, and will also tease apart some more complex theorems and/or proofs as required. In keeping with Bourbaki?s belief that a self-contained mathematics text could exist and succeed as an educational tool, my hope is that the math I discuss should be motivated and clearly defined by my discussion, and will not require the reader to independently look up terminology. 

As this is a cross-disciplinary project, with references to math, history, literature, and pedagogy, my intention is not to go to 'dive-deep any one sub-area interest, but to provide sufficient context for each so as to further my argument. 

As a final note, this paper is (will be) typeset in the LaTeX (pron: lay-tek or lah-tek) word processor. Though by no means a long-standing tradition of the mathematical community, it is a recent vanity (and for good reason -- math looks wonderful in LaTeX) and seems as though it is here to stay.  

\section{Chapter One: A Mathematico-Historical Examination of Bourbaki and the New Mathematics}
The founding members of Bourbaki were mostly mathematics students at the elite …cole Normale SupÈrieure in Paris. There, the young Normaliens were exposed to the teachings of old-guard mathematicians -- the German algebraists and French analysts. The most prominent of the latter was a text by Emile Goursat. Goursat?s Cours d'analyse mathematiques was a standard issue text for undergraduates learning analysis. The text, however, frequently offered byzantine explanations where none were needed, or completely lacked rigor where rigor was required. Theorems were re-presented multiple times, each time with new lemmas added or subtracted; in short, the Normaliens found much to be dissatisfied with in Goursat's Cours. 

	The intention to remedy the ills of the _Cours d'analyse_ provided Bourbaki with their original impetus to rewrite the classical text for university students. The problem with Goursat was just a symptom of a greater problem plaguing French mathematicians, however -- according to Mashaal's survey of Bourbaki, 'French mathematics was dwarfed by cutting-edge research in other countries, in particular by the fruitful German algebraists' (38). Mashaal argues for a long view of mathematics that, historically, has seen spurts of progress from different geographical regions of the world -- advances from Euclid and the Greeks stalled in Western Europe during the Middle Ages but were taken up elsewhere by Arab mathematicians, who developed the modern number system. Rigor -- which lay at the center of Bourbaki's project -- did not emerge until the nineteenth century, when analysts formalized the notion of infinitesimally small quantities, which they had informally used for decades (for an intuitive notion of infinitesimal quantities, think of the fraction 1/n as n grows infinitely large -- the numerator is quickly subsumed by the denominator and the fraction draws close to 0, but is never equal to 0 exactly). A rigorous argument, in a mathematical context, is one that begins from established axioms and develops according to (also-established) logical systems and theorems. One might say that there is no 'hand-waving' -- each step of the proof is well-reasoned and supported by deductive logic. 

The Normaliens' dissatisfaction with the state of university mathematics would find its counterpart in Cold War-era American dissatisfaction with public school mathematics teaching. Following the launch of Sputnik, the American government scrambled to close a perceived gap between Soviet and American mathematics proficiency. Chief among these efforts was a wholesale revamping of grade school curricula, from the first grade onwards. 'The open sesame to mathematics, according to the rigorous approach, is the theory of sets,' reads a contemporary column from the New York Times by Morris Kline, a mathematics-popularizer and professor. It is perhaps unsurprising that pure mathematicians were eager to embrace this New Math. Kline was unique in his tempered response to the move towards pure mathematics, and established this view in the aptly-titled manifesto _Why Johnny Can't Add: the Failure of the New Math_. The New York Times article from which I drew the earlier quote by Kline was, in fact, a survey of recently published books on the new math. At the end of the review, Kline concludes that the texts in question provide an enticing introduction to the purview of new math, but not much more: 'The most that these books offer is an indication of what the new mathematics is like. They may perhaps give parents the confidence to discuss junior's problems and read his textbook with him.' The implication here, which is echoed in later discussions of New Math's failure, is that New Math's sweeping program relied heavily on the quality (ironically, for Bourbaki) of the teaching materials provided and the expertise of the teachers in the classroom. Both of these things were difficult to regulate.

What parallels can we draw between the young Normaliens and the beleaguered curriculum boards of the 60s? The former were perhaps more successful in their program of rewriting and reformation than were the latter; the latter were nonetheless heavily influenced by the Normaliens and even owe much of their redirection to the French mathematicians. 




###_Bourbaki's Notation_
Nicolas Bourbaki was the collective _nom de plume_ of a group of French mathematicians who took it upon themselves to rewrite the standard textbook on analysis. Their project would expand far beyond analysis, however, eventually encompassing disciplines as disparate as topology and integration. This project was a response to the Bourbakis' dissatisfaction with the state of university mathematics teaching at the time -- notably, Edouard Goursat's _Cours d'analyse_ had long been considered a standard text for the teaching of real analysis; the Bourbakis, however, found Goursat's proof lacking in rigor and formalism and proposed to rewrite (and replace!) Goursat's text. This paper places Goursat's text in conversation with Bourbaki's _Functions of a Real Variable_ and Danielle Macbeth's 'Seeing How it Goes' in order to conclude that Goursat's text use of natural language to describe images is a cause for the text's lack of rigor, as the resulting proofs lack both the concision and precision of an image and the rigorous deductive reasoning of a textual proof. Finally, through an examination of the notation for the empty set and the dangerous bend, I argue that new notation has the effect of 'baptizing' and modularizing (and making easily manipulable) abstract notions in mathematics. This modularization allows us to manipulate and 'think within' a mathematical language. 


To a non-mathematician's eye, the _Cours_ and Bourbaki's text look very different on the page -- one might remark that Bourbaki's text has more mathematical notation ('symbols') whereas the Goursat text looks more like a novel, with paragraphs of text. Proofs are written primarily in natural language and even seem conversational, while Bourbaki's proofs are grounded in logic and manipulations of symbols. This is a bird's-eye view of both texts. We examine both texts' description of the first derivative. We note first Goursat's pithy description of a limit, which is not the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition standard in contemporary analysis textbooks, but resorts to a fairly intuitive natural language explanation: 'When the successive values of a variable _x_ approach nearer and nearer a constant quantity _a_, in such a way that the absolute value of the difference _x - a_ finally becomes and remains less than any preassigned number, the constant _a_ is called the _limit_ of the variable _x_.'

In her paper, Macbeth states that systems of symbols and signs ``more directly picture or map the things about which we speak"; in the case of the limit definition, I believe that the now-standard $\epsilon-\delta$ notation does little to help us visualize the infinitesimal. Of course, Macbeth states this function of signs in speaking about sign-symbols such as the Roman numerals, which almost function like tally marks in that they literally quantify the numeral they represent. $\epsilon-\delta$ is more relatable, in this instance, to the Arabic numerals in that $\epsilon-\delta$ notation enables ``paper-and-pencil calculations." For instance, using $\epsilon-\delta$, it is possible to obtain contradictory results when disproving statements such as $\lim_{x\rightarrow 2} x + 3 \neq 6$ (take $\epsilon = 1/2$; we see that, when $x$ nears 2, $x+3$ is at least 1/2 from 6, a contradiction).

Bourbaki gives the limit definition of the derivative, as follows:

$$\lim_{x\rightarrow x_0, x\in I, x\neq x_0} \dfrac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x - x_0},$$

where $f$ is a vector function defined on the interval $I \in \mathbb{R}$. Meanwhile, Goursat describes the first derivative as the following quotient:

$$\dfrac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}, $$

but only if this quotient approaches a limit. Notice the omission of the $\lim_{x\rightarrow x_0, x\in I, x\neq x_0}$ notation employed by Bourbaki. Notably, Goursat never describes $f'(x)$ as the \textit{derivative of f at x}, and instead seems to interpret $f(x)$ as a function $f$ over the variable $x$ -- this is in keeping with Goursat's earlier description of functions, wherein he states that a function is the machinery used to find $y$ given $x$. That is, he never describes some point $x_0$ belonging to a domain $x$, but instead treats $x$ monolithically as the variable upon which $f$ acts. As a result, the expression given by Goursat to describe the first derivative gives the derivative as $f'$ -- the new function resulting from this quotient operation. (As though to reinforce this, he attempts to give some graphical intuition for the derivative by discussing his quotient formula as a tangent line between two points, and states that ``the determination of the tangent to a curve thus reduces, analytically, to the calculation of derivatives.")

By contrast, Bourbaki describes the derivative in terms of $x_0$ belonging to the vector space. Recall that Bourbaki set out to reformulate analysis from a set theoretic perspective; now, note that Bourbaki claims that, if $f$ is differentiable at the point $x_0$, then any restriction of $f$ to an interval $J \in I$ that does not reduce to a single point is also differentiable. Bourbaki concludes the definition of the derivative by stating that the derivative is a local concept, a point that Goursat does not make because he appears to view the derivative itself as a function that transforms some $f$ into its corresponding $f'$. In making this argument, Goursat relied heavily upon the graphical representation of $f$ and its derivative -- though there are no actual drawn diagrams in the text, Goursat frequently asks his reader to imagine a graph on the Cartesian plane, or to think about the derivative in terms of slopes and lines drawn between points. Bourbaki's description of the derivative more obviously hints at the group's objective of rewriting mathematics with a set-theoretic foundation. 

For this reason, I would argue that Goursat's language is actually \textit{descriptive}, whereas Bourbaki's language is deductive and rigorous. In her paper, Macbeth provides a natural language proof of the infinitude of the primes and a graphical proof that one can construct an equilateral triangle on a straight line. The former did not require the introduction of symbols to make its point, but was easy to follow because the logic of such a proof requires only very elementary operations (addition, multiplication). The latter was effective because the claim that Macbeth is attempting to prove is a statement that a particular figure can be constructed, and so a proof-by-construction shows exactly that. 

Goursat's proof falls somewhere between both of these sensibilities. Though his writing on differentiation is devoid of diagrams, his explanations almost always use an image as a referent. For instance, on the derivative: ``Let us consider, in a plane X0Y, the curve $AMB$, which represents the function $y = f(x)$...let $M$ and $M'$ be two points on this curve, in the interval $(a, b)$, and let their abscissae be $x$ and $x + h$, respectively. The slope of the straight line $MM'$ is then precisely the quotient above. Now as $h$ approaches zero the point $M'$ approaches the approaches the point $M$; and, if the function has a derivative, the slope of the line $MM'$ approaches the limit $y'$."

We are unable to reason within the image, as we were able to with Euclid's diagrams, because there is no particular image to manipulate. Neither are we able to glean the logic of Goursat's writing from his writing alone, in the sense that his writing does not trace the logic of a proof or a deductive process. Instead, it provides a textual characterization of an image. In some senses, this shuffling between different means of representation (words and images) accounts for some lack of rigor in the _Cours d'analyse_. We are left without a visual, or a rigorous deductive explanation; some rigor and clarity are lost in translation when Goursat attempts to use words to describe an otherwise concise image. 

According to Macbeth, then, in order to ``show how it goes," mathematical language must _embody_ its contents. A fascinating example of this criterion comes about in some of the novel notations Bourbaki introduced in their text, the most well-known among these being the modern representation of the empty set, $\emptyset$. Prior to Bourbaki's invention, popular representations of the empty set included { } and { . }, constructions in the language of set theory. In a sense, this representation of the empty set was not a standalone symbol, but two symbols (a left brace and a right brace), which together formulate a set containing no elements by first initializing such a set, then populating it with no elements. By creating a standalone symbol for the empty set -- a symbol not derived from some existing notation -- Bourbaki establishes the empty set as an _a priori_ feature of set theory, notable not for its absent elements, but for its existence as a particular and important set. Here, we might make a distinction between _definition_ and _description_. The creation of new notation concretizes the concept the symbol represents and makes it definitional, much as '0' was first a placeholder and the average of -1 and 1 (these are equivalent, descriptive statements) before it became a "fully-realized" number in its own right. 

Much of the formalism of Bourbaki followed in this fashion, with new notation providing a means for representing more rigorously defined concepts that were formerly explained by Goursat-esque natural language descriptions.

An interesting meta-mathematical notation from Bourbaki is the dangerous bend, \textdbend, still in use today in some academic textbooks. Bourbaki used the dangerous bend to denote passages of his textbook that were conceptually difficult, or places where a novice might be error-prone. There is an interesting juxtaposition here between the didactic intentions of the dangerous bend and Bourbaki's lofty formalist objectives -- the former a gesture towards offering guidance to novice mathematicians, and the latter seeming, at times, to deliberately obfuscate intuitive mathematics. A similarly interesting juxtaposition can be found in Goursat's \textit{Cours}, which lacks heuristic diagrams that might aid in understanding, but also provides fairly intuitive, easy-to-read proofs (at the expense of formalism and rigor). 

In this case, where does Bourbaki's formalism come from, and how does Bourbaki's notation contribute to the formalism of the text? Reading through Bourbaki's real analysis proofs, we note a distinct structure: we begin with a definition of terms, followed by a statement of assumptions (previously proved theorems, axioms), upon which we build our argument. The rigidity of the deduction that follows is reminiscent of Hilbert's deductivism, which was, in turn, inspired by Frege's program of extreme logicism. Both Hilbert and Frege believed that mathematical proof could be distilled into its most formal and axiomatic elements and, from those, it would be possible to prove new theorems. Following in this spirit, Bourbaki's proofs proceed in an axiomatic style. 

In order to write axiomatic proofs, however, it was necessary that Bourbaki have a logical language that will permit such rigor. Frege had the \textit{Begriffsschrift}; Bourbaki made do with more informal proofs that feature a blend of natural language and 'symbols.' For these proofs, the ideal mathematical language was one that would 'embody' the mathematics it described, per Macbeth's criterion. It should also be possible to think within such a language, much as one is able to think through algebra and Euclidean diagrams. One wonders whether or not Bourbaki-an notation aids in this objective -- how do $\emptyset$ and \dbend contribute to a program of increased formalism? 

I argue that these notations do not serve any clarifying purpose when they appear in a mathematical text -- indeed, the $\lbrace \rbrace$ description of the empty set might be more informative than $\emptyset$ -- but have the effect of modularizing otherwise difficult, abstract concepts. They reference some referent but make no gesture towards clarifying or explicating this referent. The dangerous bend does this at a meta-mathematical level, concretizing the existence of a difficult-to-grasp concept without offering any means for simplifying or coming to terms with this difficulty. Just as we might mark a long inline equation with an $(*)$ so that we may refer to the entire sentence as $(*)$ at a later time, $\emptyset$ is a wrapper for $\lbrace \rbrace$ but also ``baptizes" the existence of the empty set; similarly, the dangerous bend neatly encapsulates any confusion or errors that might arise at a particular point in the passage. 



The effect of both notations, though they exist at different levels of reasoning (one within a mathematical and the other a meta-mathematical context), is to make these otherwise abstract and hard-to-grasp concepts portable, so that, even if we do not have an intuitive grasp of them, we can still manipulate them within a rigorous mathematical language (e.g., we can use the empty set to think through set theory). 

Goursat's _Cours d'analyse_ was a standard for mathematics teaching before Bourbaki's project; one wonders if standards for formalism had evolved between the time of the _Cours_ and Bourbaki's work. From a 21st century perspective, however, an examination of Goursat's text reveals a method proof that straddles the graphical and the textual, in the process losing the concision of the former and the rigor of the latter. Bourbaki ameliorates this by introducing new notation. These new symbols do not themselves explain difficult concepts, but represent these abstractions in such a way that we are able to easily manipulate these concepts via their symbolic representations and think _with_ these symbols, allowing us to embed this new notation within existing mathematical language.  

_Bourbaki's Structures_
Set theory was previously mentioned as a unifying force behind the mathematics in The Elements -- it was a means by which Bourbaki could make rigorous their mathematical arguments, but also made a convincing case for a 'unified' mathematics. Bourbaki took inspiration from the German mathematician David Hilbert, who had also pursued a _formalist_ program of writing about mathematics (he worked extensively in mathematical logic and metamathematics, the study of the study of mathematics). Hilbert is well-known today for his collection of 23 Problems, a collection of 23 open problems from disparate mathematical disciplines. The writing of these problems was a feat in itself for a single mathematician -- some would argue that Hilbert was one of the last universalist mathematicians (those mathematicians with a broad knowledge of all subfields of mathematics), and his 23 problems were evidence of this. It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that he expressed some concern over the splitting and specialization of sub-branches of mathematics, the process of which Jean Dieudonne of Bourbaki would later liken to the construction of the Tower of Babel:

'The question is urged upon us whether mathematics is doomed to the fate of those other sciences that have split up into separate branches, whose representatives scarcely understand one another and whose connections become ever more loose. I do not believe this nor wish it. Mathematical science is in my opinion an indivisible whole...' 

Dieudonne, writing in The Architecture of Mathematics (which was to become a founding document for the Bourbaki group), responded to Hilbert's concerns with a solution that hinted at early inclinations towards mathematical structuralism. Some theories in distinct subfields of mathematics, while different at first glance, could be seen to be analogous to one another, upon closer inspection. The search for these deeper connections provided the impetus for the use of the axiomatic method, which sought to phrase these theories in terms of a common deductive language. Mathematical structures, to the Bourbakis, were crucial in this program of unification. 


The modularity and conciseness of this new notation lent itself to Bourbaki's particular emphasis on mathematical \textit{structures} -- wh
