<p>The shirt bore six words in a blocky, sans-serif font across the chest. A printed tag informed me that these were the words of one Jenny Holzer, a conceptual artist; these words were ‘ACTION CAUSES MORE TROUBLE THAN THOUGHT.’</p>

<p>At the National Arts Club, a woman read my shirt, nodded, and said, ‘good for you.’</p>
