		<h1>on thrifting</h1>
<p>25 Mar 2019 - madxiaodisease </p>

<p>The first place I visited after I’d moved in – after I’d arranged and rearranged my furniture, bought a week’s groceries and bid my parents farewell – was a thrift shop. It made sense to check out a secondhand store, given budget constraints and the Upper West Side’s reputation for, uh, cost.</p>

<p>What began as a hunt for cheap tchotchkes for my room has since become a weekend hobby. I’ve learned that secondhand stores hold a mirror to the communities that supply them with their stock. The thrift stores on the UWS are full of coffee table books and Jonathan Adler housewares and signed prints from semi-famous artists. In the East Village, I found a thrift shop that seemed to carry every kind of flannel and jean jacket under the sun, and in Murray Hill, still, I found a vintage shop that specializes in foreign currencies and old maps. The haunts of well-off artists, hipsters, and financiers. I’ve spent hours in all of them – if I’m exploring a neighborhood for the first time, I generally make a beeline for its thrift shops.</p>
