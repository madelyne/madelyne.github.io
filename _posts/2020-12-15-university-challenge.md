title: University Challenge

The high school quiz show is offered, variously, as NAQT (nationally), NSC, *It's Academic* (locally, to the DMV), and 

For four years in high school, I was an enthusiastic participant in something called Academic Team, which competed once a week in something called an Academic Tournament, and culminated at the end of February with an Academic Tournament Championship. The few hours after the last period of each weekday were ripe for fruitful extracurricular diversion (for the athletically ungifted, the more curricular, the better) in service of college admissions, so I spent ninety minutes on Tuesdays and Thursdays with about two dozen other weirdos who'd determined that, after a full day of classes, they wanted nothing more than a superdistilled version of mandatory reading. 

Even then, I think I understood that facts were what you got when you were only interested in the atomic kernel at the heart of some lengthier truth. Later, in college, I would learn something about *a posteriori* knowledge, and that facts were articles of *a posteriori* furniture that you could pack into your brain. But, before I could gloss it, I was only aware of the low thrill I got from knowing things, knowing indiscriminately, knowing for the sake of knowing. I devoured chapters of a book called *Campbell's Constant Quiz Companion* when I was raring for a hit and a reliable high. It was always something different: Oscar winners, state birds, 

You could distinguish yourself as a knower of niche facts, or anchor the team as a generalist. I was somewhere between the two: I knew more than anyone else did about English literature, but could be counted on to answer the odd question about history or math. As "lit person," the first thing I learned about was the existence of a quiz deck canon, whose inclusions ranged from members of the AP English hit parade to the understatedly bizarre (why, for instance, do I still retain every fact a person could want to know about "Trees," that twelve-line poem by Joyce Kilmer?).  


I wasn't athletic or charismatic enough for sports or any kind of performing art, so I went all in on coursework.
