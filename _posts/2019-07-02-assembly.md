Below is a sample coding challenge (and accompanying solution code) for a unit in the molecular genomics curriculum I developed as a Helen Fellow at the AMNH. The assembly program algorithm was inspired by an assignment I encountered in Stanford University's CS107 Intro to Systems course (the defrag assignment, now retired).

### sequence assembly: so many ways to put the pieces together!

It's the moment you've been waiting for! How, exactly, do we go about assembling two nucleotide sequences? We'll discuss our pair-solutions before coming up with a solution together...

YOUR SOLUTION: how would you summarize your approach to someone who doesn't know anything about biology or computer science? Jot down your ideas here: 

--------------------------------------------------


How would you translate these ideas into pseudocode? Write a pseudocode outline of your algorithm below:

--------------------------------------------------


OUR SOLUTION: 


```python
str2 = 'ATGCG'
str1 = 'TGC'

def find_ind(seq1, seq2):
    match_length = 0
    max_match = 0

    for i in range(0, len(seq2)):
        for j in range(0, len(seq1)):
            if seq2[i] == seq1[j]:
                #print('match found' + str(i) + str(j))
                match_length = len(seq1) - j
                #print(match_length)
                if seq1[j:] == seq2[i:i+match_length]:
                    #print(seq1[j:])
                    if match_length > max_match:
                        max_match = match_length
                        str1_start = j
                        str2_start = i
                else:
                    continue
    return (max_match, str1_start, str2_start)

def reassembler(seq1, seq2, start2):
    return(seq1 + seq2[start2:])


def assemble(seq1, seq2): 
    str1_start = 0
    str2_start = 0
    ##one seq is completely contained within the other
    if seq1.find(seq2) > 0:
        return seq1
    elif seq2.find(seq1) > 0:
        return seq2
    
    soln1 = find_ind(seq1, seq2)
    soln2 = find_ind(seq2, seq1)
    print(soln1, soln2)
    if soln1[0] > soln2[0]:
        print(reassembler(seq1, seq2, soln2[2]))
    else:
        print(reassembler(seq2, seq1, soln1[2]))



assemble(str1, str2)
```


What if we wanted to assemble 3 fragments? How could we call on our function for two fragments to accomplish this?
